# odin-recipes
First project in The Odin Project Foundations curriculum. Test HTML skills.


This project is a demonstration of what I have learned in HTML through The Odin Project Foundations course thus far. In this project I will have demonstrated the following:
- Create pages through the use of the CLI terminal command "touch"
- Create relative and absolute links from the homepage to multiple pages
- Create lists to list ingredients and steps for recipes
- Create an HTML boilerplate
- Use heading and paragraph tags to provide structure to my content
- Use text formatting tags like strong and em to provide importance and emphasis to content
- Use the img tag to add variety into my website
- Good practices for commit messages and atomic commits in Git
