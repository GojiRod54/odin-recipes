        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>In Puerto Rico (where my family is from), flan (also known as "flan de queso") is a delicious dessert typically made for holidays. Flan is creamy and slightly dense, with a texture similar to cheesecake. The caramel topping is a mix of sweet and salty and brings it all together. This recipe is a one blender recipe and is super easy to make, store, and share with friends and family!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Quantity: Makes 2 small round aluminum pans</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cream Cheese - 1 bar</li>
            <li>Evaporated Milk - 1 can (we usually buy Carnation brand)</li>
            <li>Condensed Milk - 1 can</li>
            <li>Large Egg - 4 eggs</li>
            <li>Vanilla Extract - 2 capfulls (~1.5 tbsp)</li>
            <li>Sugar - 2 cups</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>Caramel Syrup:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a medium-sized pot, pour 2 cups of sugar.</li>
                <li>Stir the sugar over medium heat, using a wooden spoon. If you use a metal spoon, the sugar may stay on the heat too long and burn, as the metal will draw away heat from the pot.</li>
                <li>Monitor the color of the sugar as you stir. Make sure to scrape the sides of the pot frequently.</li>
                <li>Once the sugar is a medium amber color (not dark but not clear amber), take the sugar off the heat.</li>
                <li>Pour the sugar on the bottom of each of the two aluminum pans. Rotate the pans so that the sugar covers the entire bottoms.</li>
            </ol>
        <h3>Custard:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pre-heat your oven to 300&deg;F.</li>
                <li>In a blender, place the block of cream cheese and then pour all other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Blend on medium to high power (if your blender has power settings). Otherwise, pick either the "Mix" or "Pur√©e" on your blender.</li>
                <li>Once all ingredients are combined and there are no clumps in the custard, pour the mixture into the pans.</li>
                <li>Grab a separate baking sheet or tray. Place the pans into the tray, then pour water in the baking sheet until the water is halfway up the aluminum pan in height. If you see the pans start to float, you have more than enough water.</li>
                <li>Bake for 45 minutes at 300&deg;F.</li>
                <li>Check the flan using a toothpick. Poke it in the center and make sure it comes out clean. You can also check that the top is lightly caramelized (light brown color around edges or across top)</li>
                <li>Let cool for 2 hours so the custard can set.</li>
            </ol>
        <p></p>
        
        <h3>Serving:</h3>
        <p>Once the flan is finished, use a butter knife around the edges to loosen it from the pan. You can serve directly out of the pan you baked it in once it is cooled for an easy serving plate and storage solution. Flan must be stored in the refrigerator, and lasts up to up to 2 weeks.</p>
