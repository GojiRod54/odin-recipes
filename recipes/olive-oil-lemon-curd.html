        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>In the heat of summer, there's many a cold treat to eat, but none, at least in my opinion, come close to being as refreshing as a good lemon curd. You may ask "Not even ice cream?". Nope, not even ice cream (sacriledge, I know). Lemon curd is one of those desserts that sounds fancy and impressive, but is actually really easy to make. All it takes are some common pantry ingredients and lemons. And for those looking for a healthier take on lemon curd, this Olive Oil Lemon Curd is sure to be a hit.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>Quantity: Makes 16 oz of custard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Egg Yolk - 4 large eggs @ room temp</li>
                <li>Sugar, white granulated - 9 tbsp</li>
                <li>Salt - 1 tsp</li>
                <li>Olive Oil - 10 tsp</li>
                <li>Lemons - 2 medium- to large-sized lemons</li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Get a medium to large bot and fill with water halfway.</li>
            <li>Over low-medium to medium heat, let the water begin to boil</li>
            <li>Crack 4 eggs ans separate the yolks into a glass or ceramic bowl (the whites can be used for anything from an omelette to meringues).</li>
            <li>Whisk in sugar until the mixture is light in color and there are no granules in the liquid.</li>
            <li>Add salt and mix until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Zest lemons and add into mixture. Then add juice and mix until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Place the bowl on the pot of boiling water and stir until the mixture is thick enough to form loose ribbons (the mixture drips into the bowl and does not immediately settle. You should be able to see the place where the liquid dropped off the spoon briefly before it levels out again.)</li>
            <li>Once the mixture is slightly thickened, add butter ans whisk until incorporated. The mixture should not have clumps and should not separate after the butter is incorporated.</li>
            <li>Take the bowl off the pot and place in a bath of cool water. </li>
            <li>Drizzle in olive oil while stirring continuously to ensure that the mixture does not separate.</li>
            <li>Once the bowl is cooled, cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Serving:</h3>
        <p>After refrigerating the curd should be thick and glossy. You can put into a bowl with fruit and yogurt, or use it to bake things like lemon bars. Any way you want it, this curd is good for!</p>
